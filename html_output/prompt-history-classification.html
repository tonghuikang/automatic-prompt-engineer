      <td id="T_49d7d_row3_col7" class="data row3 col7" >### Summary of Current Performance<br><br>The current classification model demonstrates a **bad_question_recall** of **61.54%** and a **good_question_recall** of **68.75%**, with an overall accuracy of **57%**. While the model shows moderate effectiveness in identifying good questions, it continues to underperform in accurately recognizing bad questions. Specifically, a significant number of **bad_question** instances are being misclassified as **good_question**, indicating challenges in distinguishing nuanced or borderline cases.<br><br>### Key Mistakes Observed<br><br>**Primary Issue:**  <br>The model frequently misclassifies **bad_question** labels as **good_question**. This suggests difficulties in identifying subtle flaws such as implicit assumptions, leading language, or insufficient context that render a question problematic.<br><br>**Examples of Misclassifications:**<br><br>1. **Incorrectly Labeled as Good Question:**<br>   - **Datapoint:**<br>     - **Text:** &quot;What other information would you need to feel comfortable purchasing from Omaha Steaks?&quot;<br>     - **Model Response:** Classified as **good_question**<br>     - **Correct Label:** **bad_question**<br><br>2. **Incorrectly Labeled as Good Question:**<br>   - **Datapoint:**<br>     - **Text:** &quot;Are there other similar stories in other religions or mythologies that involve deities taking on human forms?&quot;<br>     - **Model Response:** Classified as **good_question**<br>     - **Correct Label:** **bad_question**<br><br>3. **Incorrectly Labeled as Good Question:**<br>   - **Datapoint:**<br>     - **Text:** &quot;Why don&#x27;t Omaha Steaks show photos of their raw steaks?&quot;<br>     - **Model Response:** Classified as **bad_question**<br>     - **Correct Label:** **good_question**<br><br>4. **Incorrectly Labeled as Bad Question:**<br>   - **Datapoint:**<br>     - **Text:** &quot;Do you think some billionaires intentionally underreport their wealth?&quot;<br>     - **Model Response:** Classified as **bad_question**<br>     - **Correct Label:** **good_question**<br><br>**Common Traits in Misclassified Questions:**<br>- **Implicit Assumptions:** Questions that contain hidden or indirect premises.<br>- **Leading/Loaded Language:** Phrasing that suggests a particular answer or contains biased terms.<br>- **Insufficient Context:** References to specific contexts or niche topics without adequate background.<br>- **Subjectivity:** Questions that seek personal opinions or are speculative in nature.<br>- **Ambiguity:** Vague or unclear phrasing that obscures the intent of the question.<br><br>### Proposed Changes to the Prompt<br><br>To address the low **bad_question_recall** and improve overall classification accuracy, the following modifications to the prompts are proposed:<br><br>1. **Refined Definitions:**<br>   - **good_question:** Maintain clarity and objectivity, emphasizing the absence of implicit assumptions and sufficient context.<br>   - **bad_question:** Highlight the presence of implicit assumptions, leading language, and insufficient context more explicitly.<br><br>2. **Expanded Invalid Reasons:**<br>   - Introduce **Implicit Assumptions** and **Loaded Language** as distinct invalid reasons to better capture the nuances causing misclassifications.<br>   - Clearly differentiate between similar invalid reasons to avoid overlap and confusion.<br><br>3. **Enhanced Examples:**<br>   - Incorporate additional examples, especially those that represent borderline or nuanced cases, to provide clearer guidance.<br>   - Ensure examples cover a diverse range of scenarios where the model previously erred.<br><br>4. **Strict Instruction on Classification:**<br>   - Reinforce that the model should focus solely on classifying the text without providing unsolicited explanations or declining to classify.<br>   - Emphasize brevity and relevance in the reasoning provided to ensure conciseness.<br><br>5. **Format Enforcement:**<br>   - Clearly specify the required response format, ensuring that labels are enclosed within the exact HTML tags and follow the prescribed structure.<br>   - Include reminders about maintaining the integrity of the label text to match expected labels precisely.<br><br>### Updated Prompt Parameters<br><br>```xml<br>&lt;system_prompt&gt;<br>You are an assistant that classifies questions into one of the following labels: {&#x27;good_question&#x27;, &#x27;bad_question&#x27;}.<br><br>**Definitions:**<br>- **good_question:** A question that is clear, objective, well-structured, and seeks to gain knowledge or insight.

This should facilitate more accurate and reliable classification of questions, particularly improving the identification and labeling of bad questions.</td>
