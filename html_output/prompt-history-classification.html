The assistant now understands to classify acceptable content as &#x27;0&#x27; and disallowed content as &#x27;1&#x27;, preventing previous misclassifications. The inclusion of invalid reasons for labeling ensures the LLM does not incorrectly label texts due to personal biases or misunderstandings.</td>
