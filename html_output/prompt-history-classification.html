      <td id="T_7f783_row3_col7" class="data row3 col7" ># Interpretation of Labels<br><br>After analyzing the examples, I see that the current interpretation of labels has some inconsistencies. Here&#x27;s my refined understanding:<br><br>**Label 0**: Questions seeking objective information about general topics, including:<br>- Educational concepts, scientific information, technical knowledge<br>- Professional practices, business operations, general work environments<br>- Political principles and societal trends discussed in abstract terms<br>- General knowledge questions about real-world phenomena<br>- Personal financial management in general terms<br>- Questions about how to handle emotional situations in general <br><br>**Label 1**: Questions focusing on specifics, including:<br>- Specific scenarios, case studies, or personal experiences<br>- Questions about specific events, people, or situations rather than general principles<br>- Implications of trends rather than just describing them<br>- Questions about specialized topics like human cells, forensic techniques<br>- Questions about fictional universes (like Pokémon)<br>- Religious/mythological stories and cultural interpretations<br>- Questions containing personal pronouns that refer to specific individuals<br>- Questions about specific business interactions or political events<br>- Questions asking for specific examples rather than general information<br><br>The key distinction appears to be between general/abstract (Label 0) versus specific/concrete (Label 1), regardless of topic area. Questions using &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot; may be Label 0 if they&#x27;re asking about general experiences rather than specific personal experiences.<br><br>&lt;system_prompt&gt;<br>You are a text classifier that categorizes questions into exactly one of two labels: 0 or 1.<br><br>Label 0: Questions seeking objective information about general topics, including:<br>- Educational concepts, scientific information, technical knowledge<br>- Professional practices, business operations, work environments discussed generally<br>- Political principles and societal trends discussed in abstract terms<br>- How to handle personal or emotional situations generally<br>- General knowledge questions about real-world phenomena<br>- Questions about financial concepts, economic principles in general<br><br>Label 1: Questions focusing on specifics, including:<br>- Questions about specific scenarios, case studies, or personal situations<br>- Questions about specific events, people, or experiences rather than general principles<br>- Questions seeking examples rather than explanations of concepts<br>- Questions about implications of trends rather than just describing them<br>- Questions about specialized topics (specific human cells, forensic techniques)<br>- Questions about fictional universes (like Pokémon)<br>- Questions about religious/mythological stories or cultural interpretations<br>- Questions about specific business interactions or transactions<br>- Questions asking about specific political events or figures&#x27; actions<br>- Questions about specific historical experiences or contexts<br>- Questions about celestial symbolism or navigation<br><br>Important: The label is determined by whether the question is about general knowledge/principles (Label 0) or specific instances/examples/implications (Label 1), NOT by the presence of phrases like &quot;do you think&quot; or &quot;your thoughts.&quot;<br><br>Invalid classification reasons:<br>- Classifying based solely on the presence of words like &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;<br>- Classifying based on topic (politics, religion, finance) rather than whether it&#x27;s general or specific<br>- Assuming personal questions are always Label 1 - they can be Label 0 if asking about general aspects<br>- Classifying based on question format rather than content<br><br>Examples of Label 0:<br>- &quot;What are some ways companies can create a more flexible work environment?&quot; (general principle)<br>- &quot;Why would someone choose to invest in real estate?&quot; (general economic concept)<br>- &quot;How did you manage your money during your deployment?&quot; (general financial practice)<br>- &quot;What could you do to help your son feel more comfortable expressing his emotions?&quot; (general advice)<br>- &quot;Do you think DeSantis would have been a good president?&quot; (general political assessment)<br>- &quot;What are the societal pressures that contribute to men being discouraged from expressing their emotions?&quot; (general societal trend)<br><br>Examples of Label 1:<br>- &quot;Should your colleague factor in the interest on the loan into his calculations?&quot; (specific scenario)<br>- &quot;Is it common for fathers to act this way?&quot; (specific behavior)<br>- &quot;What are some examples of children who exhibit similar behavior?&quot; (specific examples)<br>- &quot;Is the trend of students becoming more &#x27;obedient and good kids&#x27; a positive or negative development for Japan?&quot; (implications of trend)<br>- &quot;What are the implications of the current situation between the US and China?&quot; (specific situation implications)<br>- &quot;Did you use financing for all $12,000?&quot; (specific financial transaction)<br>- &quot;What other human cell types have a low metabolic rate?&quot; (specific examples in science)<br>- &quot;What are some other factors that forensic scientists use to estimate time of death?&quot; (specific examples)<br>- &quot;Do you think the sympathy wave would have been enough to secure a win for DeSantis?&quot; (specific political scenario)<br>&lt;/system_prompt&gt;<br><br>&lt;user_prompt_prefix&gt;<br>Classify the following text into either label 0 or label 1:<br><br>Label 0: Questions about general knowledge, concepts, or principles - seeking information about educational topics, scientific concepts, business practices, societal trends, professional standards, or abstract principles discussed in general terms.<br><br>Label 1: Questions about specific examples, scenarios, situations, implications, fictional universes, religious/mythological stories, cultural interpretations, specialized case studies, or personal experiences.<br><br>Text to classify: <br>&lt;/user_prompt_prefix&gt;<br><br>&lt;user_prompt_suffix&gt;<br><br>Remember that the key distinction is whether the question asks about general knowledge/principles (Label 0) or specific instances/examples/implications (Label 1). The topic area (politics, religion, finance, etc.) is not what determines the label.<br><br>Provide your reasoning first, explaining why this falls under general knowledge or specific examples, then end with your classification in exactly this format: &quot;Label: &lt;label&gt;X&lt;/label&gt;&quot; where X is either 0 or 1.<br>&lt;/user_prompt_suffix&gt;<br><br>My improved prompts address several key issues:<br><br>1. **Clarified the fundamental distinction** between Labels 0 and 1 as general vs. specific rather than by topic area<br><br>2. **Added more explicit examples** that match the correct labels from the provided examples<br><br>3. **Added a section on invalid classification reasons** to avoid common misclassification patterns<br><br>4. **Improved the examples section** to include a wider range of correctly labeled examples, including those that were previously misclassified<br><br>5. **Streamlined the Label 0 and Label 1 descriptions** to focus on the general vs. specific distinction rather than topic areas<br><br>6. **Added examples that illustrate counterintuitive cases** - like personal questions that should be Label 0 because they&#x27;re asking about general principles<br><br>7. **Emphasized in both user prompts** that topic area is not determinative of the label<br><br>These improvements should help the model better distinguish between questions about general knowledge (Label 0) and questions about specific examples, scenarios, or implications (Label 1), regardless of the topic area.</td>
