Instead, their motions were better explained by the Heliocentric Model, which placed the Sun at the center of the solar system.<br><br>2.

The Heliocentric Model was able to account for this observation.<br><br>3. Galileo&#x27;s observations: Galileo&#x27;s observations of the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus provided strong evidence in favor of the Heliocentric Model and against the Geocentric Model.<br><br>4. Copernicus&#x27; mathematical model: Nicolaus Copernicus developed a mathematical model that placed the Sun at the center of the solar system and was able to more accurately predict the motions of the planets compared to the Geocentric Model.<br><br>Overall, the Geocentric Model was eventually abandoned in favor of the Heliocentric Model, which better explained the observed celestial phenomena and provided a more accurate representation of the structure of the solar system.<br>&lt;/Text&gt;</td>

The basic idea is to model the way humans store and process information, with related concepts connected through various types of associations.<br><br>In a semantic network, each node represents a concept or object, and the links between nodes represent the relationships between those concepts. These relationships can be of different types, such as &quot;is-a&quot; (for hierarchical relationships), &quot;part-of&quot; (for part-whole relationships), or more specific semantic relations like &quot;causes&quot;, &quot;uses&quot;, or &quot;located-in&quot;.<br><br>The structure of a semantic network allows for efficient storage and retrieval of information, as well as inference and reasoning. By traversing the network, you can follow the connections between concepts to understand their relationships and draw conclusions. Semantic networks are used in various applications, such as natural language processing, knowledge representation, and expert systems.<br>&lt;/Text&gt;</td>
