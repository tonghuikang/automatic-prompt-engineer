      <td id="T_a6c45_row25_col1" class="data row25 col1" > This question is a bit leading, as it suggests that violence in politics should be condemned without providing a neutral prompt for the respondent to consider the importance or lack thereof. The question also contains an implicit assumption that violence in politics is inherently problematic, which may not be a universally accepted premise. While the intent behind the question may be to encourage thoughtful discussion, the phrasing could be improved to be more objective and open-ended.<br><br>Label: &lt;label&gt;bad_question&lt;/label&gt;</td>

It does not provide any objective criteria for evaluating his potential presidency.

      <td id="T_a6c45_row27_col1" class="data row27 col1" > This question contains an implicit assumption that ancient Hindus used constellations to navigate the path of departed souls. The question does not provide sufficient context or background information to determine if this is a widely accepted or verifiable claim. Additionally, the question is somewhat leading, as it suggests that there may be evidence for this specific practice, without clearly defining the scope or nature of the evidence being sought. Overall, this question lacks objectivity and could benefit from more clarity and context.<br><br>Label: &lt;label&gt;bad_question&lt;/label&gt;</td>

It does not have a clear, objective purpose or seek to gain universal knowledge. The question also relies on the assumption that the person has a father and that their father has done something &quot;thoughtful&quot; for them, which may not be the case for everyone.
