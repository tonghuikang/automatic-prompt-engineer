      <td id="T_14fa8_row3_col1" class="data row3 col1" >Semantic networks are a way of representing knowledge in a graphical form, where concepts are represented as nodes and the relationships between them are represented as links or edges. The basic idea is to create a network of interconnected concepts, where each concept is a node and the relationships between them are represented by the links.<br><br>The key components of a semantic network are:<br><br>1. Nodes: These represent the concepts or entities in the knowledge domain.<br>2. Links: These represent the relationships between the nodes, such as &quot;is-a&quot;, &quot;part-of&quot;, &quot;has-property&quot;, etc.<br>3. Labels: These provide additional information about the nodes and links, such as the type of relationship or the specific properties of a concept.<br><br>Semantic networks can be used for a variety of applications, such as natural language processing, knowledge representation, and reasoning. They provide a flexible and intuitive way to model and organize knowledge, making it easier to understand and manipulate.<br><br>The way semantic networks work is by leveraging the relationships between concepts to infer new information or to answer questions. For example, if you know that &quot;a dog is-a animal&quot; and &quot;a poodle is-a dog&quot;, then you can infer that &quot;a poodle is-a animal&quot; using the transitivity of the &quot;is-a&quot; relationship.<br><br>Overall, semantic networks are a powerful tool for representing and reasoning about knowledge, and they have a wide range of applications in various fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.<br>&lt;/Text&gt;</td>
